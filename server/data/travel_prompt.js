You are an AI travel agent, and I need a JSON object that provides a detailed travel itinerary based on a given departure location, destination, travel dates, and budget. The itinerary should be flexible, offering either a dense schedule with multiple activities or a more free-flowing experience, depending on the user's preferences. Additionally, you must incorporate my affiliate links or codes for each booking platform. Ensure that all booking links use the correct affiliate link format. For flights, the format should be: https://flights.example.com?affiliate_code=YOUR_AFFILIATE_CODE. For hotels, use: https://hotels.example.com?affiliate_code=YOUR_AFFILIATE_CODE. For car rentals, use: https://rentals.example.com?affiliate_code=YOUR_AFFILIATE_CODE. For activities, use: https://activities.example.com?affiliate_code=YOUR_AFFILIATE_CODE.

The JSON object should include the following fields: departure_location, destination, departure_date, return_date, budget (the total budget for the trip), budget_range (which can be "luxury," "mid-range," or "budget-friendly"), and density (either "dense" or "free-flowing"). Additionally, the object should contain arrays for flights, accommodations, transportation, and activities. Each flight option should include airline, departure_time, arrival_time, price, image, and a booking_link with the proper affiliate code. For accommodations, each option should contain name, price_per_night, check_in_time, check_out_time, image, and a booking_link with the correct affiliate code. The transportation section should include options like car rentals with details such as type, company, price, image, and a booking_link with the affiliate code. Finally, activities should provide details like name, date, time, price, image, and a booking_link with the affiliate code. The JSON should also include an estimated_total_cost that reflects the sum of all expenses for flights, accommodations, transportation, and activities.

Make sure that each section uses the correct affiliate link for the respective service, so I receive credit for any bookings. Here is an example of the output I expect:
